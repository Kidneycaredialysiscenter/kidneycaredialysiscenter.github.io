Welcome to my homepage.

I am currently pursuing an MSc (Thesis) in Computing Science at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/index.html), under the supervision of [Dr. Matthew E. Taylor](https://drmatttaylor.net/). Previously, I worked as a software developer at [Microsoft IDC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/msidc/). My research interests include Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Robotics, Reinforcement Learning, and related fields.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering, with an Honors in Robotics, from [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/). During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a researcher at the [Robotics Research Center](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/) at IIIT Hyderabad.

Here's the link to my updated (long ago) [resume](https://kharyal.github.io//CV.pdf) and my (Updated: 18-Dec-23) [academic CV](https://kharyal.github.io//academic.pdf)


#### Current Research
Currently, I am working on problems related to machine teaching, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and curriculum learning.

#### My Research Statement
The human brain and body have evolved over millions of years to become incredibly complex, making it difficult for us to fully understand our own capabilities. However, the challenge of replicating human-level intelligence in computers is a goal that drives many areas of research, including Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Robotics, and Reinforcement Learning, which is why they intrigue me as much as they do. My ultimate aim is to contribute to this goal and gain a deeper understanding of human behavior and decision-making.
