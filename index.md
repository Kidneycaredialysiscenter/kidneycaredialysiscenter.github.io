My research interests include Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Robotics, Reinforcement Learning and related fields.


I have completed my Bachelors degree from [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) in Electronics and Communication Engineering. You can find the codes written by me on my [github page](https://github.com/kharyal).
